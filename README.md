Satellite Positioning Data Analysis and Visualization
Overview

This project analyzes satellite positioning data obtained from CSV files using Python and pandas. The goal is to visualize the satellite's position over time and calculate its orbital period based on the semi-major axis provided in the dataset.
Goals

1.	Data Analysis: Process and clean satellite positioning data to prepare it for visualization.
2.	Visualization: Create interactive plots to visualize the satellite's movement over time.
3.	Orbital Period Calculation: Implement a function to calculate the orbital period using Kepler's third law.
4.	Dashboard Development: Explore the possibility of developing a web-based dashboard to showcase data insights and visualizations.

Achievements
•	Successfully imported and processed CSV data using pandas.
•	Implemented a Python function to calculate the orbital period based on Kepler's laws.
•	Created interactive plots using matplotlib to visualize satellite positioning data.
•	Explored the potential for developing a dashboard using Dash or Flask for future enhancements.

Challenges
•	Syntax Errors and Function Definition: Initially faced challenges with syntax errors and function definition in Python, particularly when integrating mathematical computations.
•	Data Cleaning: Addressing missing data and ensuring consistency in data types (e.g., timedelta conversion) presented initial hurdles.
•	Dashboard Development: The transition from data analysis to dashboard development posed challenges in integrating visualizations effectively and ensuring user interaction capabilities.

Next Steps
•	Refine data processing and cleaning techniques to handle larger datasets efficiently.
•	Explore advanced visualization techniques and interactivity options for the dashboard.
•	Incorporate additional data sources or parameters to enhance analysis and insights.
•	Seek feedback and iterate on the dashboard design to improve user experience and functionality.
